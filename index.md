## About Me

I graduated Boise State University with a Bachelor's degree in Astrophysics and minors in Computer Science and Computational Science and Engineering in the Spring of 2020. 

I am currently seeking employment. In the meantime I am staying busy by doing astrophysics research with one of my former professors at BSU.

I have a passion for learning and problem solving and I hope that I can utilize that in my career.

I use my GitHub page as a showcase of projects that I have completed as well as projects that are still in progress.
