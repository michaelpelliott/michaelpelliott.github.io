## Welcome to Michael Elliott's GitHub Page

I graduated Boise State University in Spring 2020 with a Bachelor's degree in Astrophysics 
and minors in Computer Science and Computational Science and Engineering. 

My github page is a showcase of projects that I have completed as well as projects that are still in progress.
